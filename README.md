The PDF files are some projects I've worked on while earning my certifications and studying to complete my Bachelor of Science in Cloud Computing.
These files showcase my skills, experience, and expertise to professionals and recruiters in the industry.
Also, writer's block can be crippling and hard to overcome.  I hope these will also inspire other students on their projects as they work towards a Cloud Computing degree.
